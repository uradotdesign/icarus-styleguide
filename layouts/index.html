            <p class="contact">We are making Icarus usable for everyone.</p>
            <p>The Icarus style guide is based on <a class="underline" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>, an open-source toolkit for developing
                with HTML, CSS,
                and JS. We are currently on <a class="underline"
                    href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Bootstrap Introduction">v5.2.0</a>.
            </p>
            <p>To improve the Icarus style guide, you can clone the repo and modify the content.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap contains a few JavaScript libraries for extra interaction with the DOM. We use these libraries
                but
                do not add extra JavaScript, so that only few elements are affected if you disable JavaScript.</p>
            <p>This style guide has been built using <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    title="Hugo" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static
                site
                generators.
                You can build this yourself by <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                <p>The components used in the Icarus Style Guide are created with portability in mind. This means they
                    can be
                    reused elsewhere without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
                <p>The easiest way to do this is to download the scss style (components.scss) and import it in your
                    project
                    with bootstrap included.</p>
                <p>If you want to use SASS you can download the complete archive for the styleguide. <a
                        class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="SASS"
                        href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> is a CSS
                    extension The scss folder under assets contains all the sass files. Since we use Bootstrap, we only
                    add
                    a few styles without modifying bootstrap core or defining new elements whenever possible.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title mt-5 mb-3" id="contribute">Contributing</h2>

                    <p>If you an interested in contributing to our design system, the first step is ensuring that an
                        issue exists in our issue tracker. There are many applications that an issue can have,
                        including:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Submitting feature proposals</li>
                        <li>Asking questions</li>
                        <li>Reporting bugs and malfunctions</li>
                        <li>Obtaining support</li>
                        <li>Enhancing code implementations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you were unable to find a related issue in our issue tracker, begin by creating a new one.
                        Creating an issue for each change allows us to easily track all proposals in one place. For
                        changes that affect visual designs or user experiences, it can be helpful to include a mockup.
                    </p>

                    <h3>UX proposals</h3>

                    <p>If your proposal involves a new guideline or UX paradigm, ping a UX reviewer or maintainer to
                        review and provide feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Frontend proposals</h3>

                    <p class="mb-5">If your proposal involves a change to the frontend implementation, ping a frontend
                        reviewer or maintainer to review and provide feedback.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Contribute a merge request</h2>

                    <p>To make changes within our Design System, follow these instructions:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose an issue to work on. If one does not exist, please review the contribution guidelines
                            regarding creating a new one. This opens the conversation and allows feedback to happen
                            early, preventing risks such as duplicated or unnecessary work. It can be helpful to comment
                            in the issue to verify that no one is working on it and that the issue is still relevant.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fork this project.</li>
                        <li>Make changes reflecting the issue you've chosen to work on.</li>
                        <li>Create a merge request. The earlier you open a merge request, the sooner you can get
                            feedback. You can mark it as a Work in Progress to signal that you're not done yet.</li>
                        <li>Get your merge request approved. If your changes involved a new guideline or UX paradigm,
                            then ping a UX reviewer or maintainer to approve your changes. If your changes involve an
                            update to frontend implementation, ping a frontend reviewer or maintainer to approve. Some
                            merge requests will require both a UX and frontend approver.</li>
                        <li>Get your changes merged! After the necessary approvals have been added, a UX or frontend
                            maintainer can then merge your merge request. ðŸ™Œ</li>
                    </ol>
